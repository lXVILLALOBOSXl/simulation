# multi-agent-systems-supply-chain

This project focuses on a supply chain scenario. Customers would order
specified computers from a manufacturer, the manufacturer would then build the
computers from the stock of items in its warehouse. The customer would set a
delivery date and price for the manufacturer to follow, and the manufacturer could
either accept or decline the order. If the manufacturer did not have the required parts
it could order more from two different suppliers. The scenario followed a specified
algorithm and the task was to see how one could generate the most profit from the
scenario.

The management of supply chains is integral to ensuring a manufacturer can make
suitable profits. Due to the rise electronic marketplaces it is only reasonable to
assume companies will resort to automated systems to deal with the huge number of
transactions at a rapid pace. Thus the performance of a supply chain can greatly
benefit from using multi-agent systems. The use of multi-agents in this scenario
allow a manufacturer to rapidly seek customer bids, source items, and build
computers specified.
